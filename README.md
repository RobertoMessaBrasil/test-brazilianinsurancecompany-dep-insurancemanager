# About

This Maven dependency is been built as an job selection process for a brazilian insurance company

## Insurance Manager

It is an [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) based components built with [DDD}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

Due to unespected delays in other commitments, I was unable to finish this dependency and use it in the [Insurance Manager Api]([https://github.com/RobertoMessaBrasil/test-brazilianinsurancecompany-dep-insurancemanager](https://github.com/RobertoMessaBrasil/test-brazilianinsurancecompany-api-insurancemanager/).

### Next steps:
1. Create the remaining Entities
2. Create the remaining UseCases
3. Create the remaining Adapters
4. Implement the business rules in the Entities and UseCases
5. Create the unit tests
